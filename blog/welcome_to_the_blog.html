			Hi! My name is Lorenzo, I live in Switzerland and I just recently got my Bachelor&#39;s degree
			in software engineering!
		</p>
		<p>
			I started programming in elementary school with the Minecraft&#39;s ComputerCraft mod using
			the LUA programming language. The moment I wrote my first Hello World and saw those words
			appear on my old iMac&#39;s screen, I immediately fell in love with programming. Now, years
			later, I&#39;m ready to start my career as a software engineer!
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout the years I developed a passion for Linux (I use Fedora btw), open-source and
			programming. I love to make things, explore already existing projects and break stuff!
		</p>
		<p>
			This blog is a random collection of my experiments without much structure. Whenever I do
			something that I think is interesting, I&#39;ll probably write a new post on this blog.
		</p>
		<p>
			I don&#39;t really know what else to add, so I&#39;m going to end the post here. I already
			have a few posts in mind that I&#39;m going to publish pretty soon, so stay tuned!
		</p>
		<p>Have a nice day!</p>
		<p>P.S.: The RSS feed is coming soon™️.</p>
