## Welcome!

Hi there! I’m Lorenzo, a recent software‑engineering graduate from Switzerland. I’ve been tinkering with computers since I was a kid, and I specialize in software development and Linux system administration. I’m now looking to apply my skills in a real-world setting.

When I learn something new, I like to write a quick blog post about it because I think that explaining a topic - even if nobody reads it - is the best way improve my understanding.

If you want to talk, you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-adam-piazza).

You can also check out some of my projects on my [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/lorenzo_adam_piazza) or [GitHub](https://github.com/JollyCookie2000).
