# Welcome to the blog!

Hi! My name is Lorenzo, I live in Switzerland and I just recently got my Bachelor's degree in software engineering!

I started programming in elementary school with the Minecraft's ComputerCraft mod using the LUA programming language. The moment I wrote my first Hello World and saw those words appear on my old iMac's screen, I immediately fell in love with programming. Now, years later, I'm ready to start my career as a software engineer!

Throughout the years I developed a passion for Linux (I use Fedora btw), open-source and programming. I love to make things, explore already existing projects and break stuff!

This blog is a random collection of my experiments without much structure. Whenever I do something that I think is interesting, I'll probably write a new post on this blog.

I don't really know what else to add, so I'm going to end the post here. I already have a few posts in mind that I'm going to publish pretty soon, so stay tuned!

Have a nice day!

P.S.: The RSS feed is coming soon™️.
