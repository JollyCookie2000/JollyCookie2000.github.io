		<h2>About me</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Hello! I'm Lorenzo, a recent software engineering graduate from Switzerland with a strong
			passion for programming and technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			From a young age, I have been fascinated by computers and have spent countless hours honing my
			programming skills in my spare time. My educational journey has deepened my knowledge and
			fueled my desire to explore new technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've always held a strong interest everything related to computers. I've been programming in
			my spare time for many years now. I love learning and trying new technologies. This passion
			brought me to pursue an education in software engineering.
		</p>
		<p>
			My current goals are to continue learning and to contribute to open-source projects that I use
			daily. I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities in the
			software development field.
