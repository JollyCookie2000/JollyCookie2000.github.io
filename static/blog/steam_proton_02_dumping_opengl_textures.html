		<p>
			Hey all! Welcome to the second post of my blog series on exploring and tinkering with
			Valve&#39;s Proton! This time I&#39;m going to do something slightly more complex than a
			simple Hello World: this time, I&#39;m going to make Proton dump all of a game&#39;s textures.
			For simplicity, I&#39;m going to be using the game
			<em>Hyperdimension Neptunia: Re;Birth1</em> which, contrary to what the its Steam page says,
			only uses OpenGL and not DirectX 10. Also, while this game is 32-bits, this implementation
			should work with any game that uses OpenGL, 32-bits or 64-bits.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Note: Copyright laws still apply! I&#39;m no lawyer, but I&#39;m pretty sure we don&#39;t
				have permission to use these textures outside of the game. This is purely for academic
				purpose.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			This is not a tutorial on OpenGL. Instead, refer to this guide that talks about textures in
			OpenGL if you want to know more:
			<a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures"
				>learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I&#39;m going to keep things as simple as possible and, as such, I&#39;m only interested in
			one function: <code>glTexImage2D</code> (<a
				href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml"
				>reference</a
			>). Of all the parameters that this function accepts, I&#39;m only interested in the
			following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>GLenum target</code>: Specifies the target texture. For now, I&#39;m only going to
				support the <code>GL_TEXTURE_2D</code> (<code>0x0DE1</code>) target.
			</li>
			<li><code>GLsizei width</code>: Specifies the width of the texture image.</li>
			<li><code>GLsizei height</code>: Specifies the height of the texture image.</li>
			<li>
				<code>GLenum format</code>: Specifies the format of the pixel data. For now, I&#39;m only
				going to support the <code>GL_RGBA</code> (<code>0x1908</code>) format, since that seems to
				be the only texture format that the game uses. It should be pretty easy to support other
				formats.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>GLenum type</code>: Specifies the data type of the pixel data. This is the data type
				in which the texture is passed to this function. For now, I&#39;m only going to support the
				<code>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> (<code>0x1401</code>) data type.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>const void* data</code>: Specifies a pointer to the image data in memory. This is the
				actual pixel data for the texture. For example, if the texture format is
				<code>GL_RGBA</code> and the data type is <code>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code>, then this argument
				is going to be a pointer to an array of unsigned bytes, where every group of 4 bytes is
				going to represent a pixel. In this example, the array will have a size of
				<em>width x height x 4 x 1</em> bytes.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Note: constants like <code>GL_TEXTURE_2D</code> are defined in the file
				<code>wine/include/wine/wgl.h</code>. You can use a command like
				<code>$ grep --recursive &#39;GL_TEXTURE_2D&#39; ./</code> to search for a specific
				constant.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			This means that, by intercepting calls to the <code>glTexImage2D</code> function, we have
			access to the pixel data of every texture as it gets loaded by the game. For this experiment,
			I&#39;m going to directly modify this function in such a way that it writes the texture data
			to a file.
		</p>
		<p>With the theory out of the way, let&#39;s start writing code!</p>
		<p>
			Like in the previous post, we have to modify a DLL. In Windows, OpenGL is implemented by the
			<code>opengl32.dll</code> DLL file, which is located under
			<code>C:\Windows\System32\opengl32.dll</code> for 64-bits and
			<code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\opengl32.dll</code> for 32-bits. In Proton, the source code for this
			DLL is located under <code>wine/dlls/opengl32/</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let&#39;s start by looking for the implementation of the <code>glTexImage2D</code> function
			with <code>$ grep --recursive --line-number &#39;glTexImage2D&#39; ./</code>. The first result
			that seems interesting is a file called <code>thunks.c</code> at line 2489. Looking at this
			line we see the following:
			<code
				>void WINAPI glTexImage2D( GLenum target, GLint level, GLint internalformat, GLsizei width,
				GLsizei height, GLint border, GLenum format, GLenum type, const void *pixels )</code
			>. That&#39;s exactly what we want! There&#39;s a warning at the beginning of the file saying
			something about not modifying the file. I&#39;m going to ignore it.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Note: I had no idea what &quot;thunk&quot; means, so I looked it up on the Internet. From
				Wikipedia:
				<em
					>In computer programming, a thunk is a subroutine used to inject a calculation into
					another subroutine.</em
				>
				In this case, I assume the file is called <code>thunks.c</code> because it contains a bunch
				of functions that do not actually do the calculations themselves and, instead, act as a
				proxy between the API that Windows applications expect and what is actually available on
				Linux.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
		<p>
			Let&#39;s review our objective. We want to dump the textures that the game loads by
			intercepting the OpenGL function calls. So, here&#39;s the plan:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<em>Get the texture data.</em> This one is easy; we receive the texture data and the texture
				size as parameters of the <code>glTexImage2D</code> function.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Make sure the texture is in a supported format.</em> This one is optional. Basically,
				check that the texture has a format that we expect (target, format and type). I&#39;m going
				to skip this check for this particular instance, since every texture in this game has the
				same format.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Encode the texture.</em> Basically, transform the array of bytes we received into an
				image format that we can easily open with a image-viewing program.
			</li>
			<li><em>Write the texture to a file.</em> Pretty self-explanatory.</li>
			<li>
				<em>Continue the execution</em>. Basically, after dumping the texture, we want to continue
				with the normal execution of the code. Otherwise, the game would just dump one texture and
				quit.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			For the first point, there&#39;s nothing extra we have to do, since we receive the texture
			data as part of the arguments to the <code>glTexImage2D</code> function.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the second point, we can put a simple if-statement that decides whether to attempt to dump
			the texture or not depending on the texture format. As already stated, I&#39;m going to skip
			this step.
		</p>
		<p>
			The third point requires a lot more work. Using popular formats like PNG or JPEG would require
			the use of an external library, due to the complexity of the these formats. The problem is
			that I&#39;m not yet sure how to include extra dependencies when compiling Proton, which means
			that I have to implement the encoder myself for now. Fortunately, there&#39;s an extremely
			simple image format that is easy to encode, decode and is human-readable! I&#39;m talking
			about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm">Portable Pixmap Format</a>! I&#39;m
			going to get into the details of this format in this post, since the Wikipedia article
			explains everything very clearly, but I&#39;m just going to leave this simple example of a 2x2
			black and white checkerboard image:
		</p>
		<pre><code>P3          <span class="hljs-comment"># Magic number indicating an RGB image</span>
2<span class="hljs-number"> 2 </span>        <span class="hljs-comment"># Image size in the format "&lt; width &gt; &lt; height &gt;"</span>
255         <span class="hljs-comment"># The maximum value of each color component.</span>

<span class="hljs-number"> 0 </span> <span class="hljs-number"> 0 </span> <span class="hljs-number"> 0 </span><span class="hljs-comment"># Top-left black</span>
255<span class="hljs-number"> 255 </span>255 <span class="hljs-comment"># Top-right white</span>
255<span class="hljs-number"> 255 </span>255 <span class="hljs-comment"># Bottom-left white</span>
<span class="hljs-number"> 0 </span> <span class="hljs-number"> 0 </span> <span class="hljs-number"> 0 </span><span class="hljs-comment"># Bottom-right black</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># Oh yeah, you can even use comments! ;)</span>
</code></pre>
		<p>
			Simply beautiful! Just copy-and-paste this text into a text file, save it as
			<code>checkerboard.ppm</code> and voil√†!
		</p>
		<p>
			There&#39;s a few downsides to this format. The first is support: as far as I know, very few
			programs actually support this format (GIMP is one of those programs. Gwenview from the KDE
			project also supports it). The second issue is file size: the fact that there&#39;s no
			compression and that each color value is specified using ASCII characters, means that files
			will be quite large (4.2 MiB for a PNG and 70.3 MiB for a PPM of the same 3200x1813 image!).
		</p>
		<p>
			The fourth point is to simply write our PPM-encoded texture to a file and, at the end,
			continue with the program&#39;s normal execution.
		</p>
		<h2 id="the-execution">The execution</h2>
		<p>Let&#39;s start by looking at how I changed the <code>glTexImage2D</code> function:</p>

			Let&#39;s now implement the logic behind the <code>dump_opengl_texture</code> function in a

	<span class="hljs-comment">// Close the file.</span>
	fclose(file);
}
</code></pre>
		<p>
			A quick note on the way I index the pixels array inside the two for loops: since
			<code>pixels</code> is a 1D array and a texture is a 2D matrix, we need to to some simple math
			to transform a 2D index (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) into a 1D index. The formula is
			pretty simple: <code>index = y * width + x</code>, where <code>index</code> is the resulting
			1D index, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the 2D index and <code>width</code> is the
			width of the 2D matrix.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also have to take into consideration the fact that the texture is made up of 4 components:
			red, green, blue and alpha, but we are exporting the texture only as RGB without the alpha
			channel. This is the reason for the <code>* 4</code> used to multiply the index, even though
			we are only considering three components. I definitely didn&#39;t waste half an hour trying to
			understand why the dumped textures were completely broken.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let&#39;s not forget to include this file inside <code>thunks.c</code>. This is a matter of
			simply adding the <code>#include &quot;dump_opengl_texture.h&quot;</code> directive at the top
			of the <code>thunks.c</code> file, after the other include directives.
		</p>
		<p>Let&#39;s now compile and run the game with the changes!</p>
		<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>
		<p>
			As soon as I started the game, magic happened: a bunch of images were appearing in the
			game&#39;s folder! Some were completely black, some were clearly used for particle effects and
			other were the game character&#39;s deformed faces. It worked!
		</p>
		<p>
			Writing a texture to disk using the PPM format results in the game freezing or slowing down
			due to the large size of the files being written. If your game freezes or stutters, that is
			probably normal.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Note: In this game, the order in which the textures are loaded depends on the player&#39;s
				actions. It is therefore not guaranteed that a texture is going to be dumped with the same
				file name each time.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			And that&#39;s all for this second post of this series! We went from writing a simple message
			to the log to dumping a game&#39;s textures! While the changes made and the code written were
			small, I still had a ton of fun and was able to understand a lot about Wine/Proton. I&#39;m
			still not sure what the next experiment will be about. Maybe I&#39;ll try to fix some of the
			games in my Steam library that do not work on Linux. Until then, see you next time!
		</p>
		<p>
			P.S.: I really like the idea of dumping a game&#39;s textures and I would like to expand it by
			adding the possibility of loading textures from disk and replace the game&#39;s original
			textures with textures of my own (different visual style? higher-definition textures? chaos?).
			Maybe I can take this even further and replace stuff like shaders and meshes.
