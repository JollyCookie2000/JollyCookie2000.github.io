<h1 id="steam-proton-01-hello-world-">Steam Proton #01 - Hello, World!</h1>
<p>
	Hi! I&#39;m Lorenzo and I&#39;ve decided to start this journey trying to understand how
	Wine/Proton work and, in the future, hopefully be able to contribute to the project. I&#39;m
	going to use this blog as a way to keep track of my progress and to maybe help someone else
	get into this amazing project.
</p>
<p>
	The first thing to do is to get Proton&#39;s source code, compile it and make sure that it
	works. After this, I would like to apply a small change to the code and make Proton print the
	string <em>Hello, World!</em> to the log.
</p>
<h2 id="environment-setup">Environment setup</h2>
<p>
	The building process is made much easier thanks to the use containers that automatically
	install and configure all the required dependencies. Since I&#39;m using Fedora Linux, I&#39;m
	going to use Podman instead of Docker.
</p>
<p>
	On Fedora, I had to set SELinux in <em>permissive</em> mode by running
	<code># setenforce 0</code>, otherwise I would get an error when trying to mount a host path
	inside a Podman container.
</p>
<p>
	Now I just had to grab the source code for Proton:
	<code
		>$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton.git proton</code
	>. For this experiment, I&#39;m using the <code>proton-9.0-3e</code> tag.
</p>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>
	Compiling Proton is fortunately very easy: just run
	<code>$ make dist container_engine=podman build_name=MyProton-9</code>. The final package will
	be located inside <code>build/build-MyProton-9/dist/</code>. The
	<code>build_name</code> variable lets us choose the display name of our custom Proton. To use
	in Steam, just copy the <code>dist/</code> directory inside
	<code>~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/</code>. Note that
	the path may be different depending on the way you installed Steam (I am using Flatpak). Also,
	if you haven&#39;t already installed some other custom version of Proton, it is likely that
	the <code>compatibilitytools.d/</code> directory does not exist; in that case, it will have to
	be created manually. It is necessary to restart Steam for the custom Proton to be detected.
	Just to be sure, it&#39;s better to delete the game&#39;s Wine prefix if it exists to avoid
	issues (<code
		>~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/&lt; game ID
		&gt;/</code
	>).
</p>
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>
	To use our custom Proton, right-click on a game in the Steam library and select
	<em>Properties...</em>. Then, under the <em>Compatibility</em> tab, check
	<em>Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool</em> and select
	<em>proton_9.0-local</em> from the drop-down menu (the name may be slightly different
	depending the Proton version used). Later I try to change the display name into something more
	unique.
</p>
<p>
	There&#39;s one last thing that needs to be done before proceeding, and that is to enable
	logging. To do this, simply go into the game&#39;s properties and, under the
	<em>General</em> tab, paste the following text into the <em>LAUNCH OPTIONS</em> text box:
	<code>PROTON_LOG=1 %command%</code>. Now, when a game is run, a log file will be created in
	your home directory (or, like in my case, in <code>~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/</code>)
	with the name <code>steam-&lt; game ID &gt;.log</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="hello-world-">Hello, World!</h2>
<p>Finally! Here comes the interesting part!</p>
<p>
	As I said in the beginning, the objective is simple: make Proton print
	<em>Hello, World!</em> in the log file. To do this, two things are needed: first we need to
	find the right place in the code to add our own custom-code and second, we need to find a way
	to print text to the log file (<code>printf</code> is actually not available at all!).
</p>
<p>
	The way Wine (and, as a consequence, Proton) is by re-implementing many of the DLLs that you
	would find on a normal Windows installation and that are used by Windows program. For this
	experiment, I decided to modify one of the DLLs, since that&#39;s where most of the
	interesting code is located. I picked <code>kernel32.dll</code> for this, since it&#39;s
	guaranteed to be loaded by any Windows program. From Wikipedia:
	<em
		>KERNEL32.DLL exposes to applications most of the Win32 base APIs, such as memory
		management, input/output (I/O) operations, process and thread creation, and synchronization
		functions.</em
	>
	(<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files"
		>wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files</a
	>). On Windows, the file is located under <code>C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll</code>. The
	source code for this DLL is located at <code>wine/dlls/kernel32/</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Let&#39;s move onto the next point: we need to find a way to print stuff to the log file. As I
	said before, <code>printf</code> is not available and as such, we need to look somewhere else.
	Fortunately, Wine puts at our disposal a series of functions to help with logging, one for
	each log level (trace, warn, err, fixme). These functions are defined in the
	<code>wine/include/wine/debug.h</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="lang-C">#define TRACE                      WINE_TRACE
#define TRACE_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)                 WINE_TRACE_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)
#define TRACE_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)               WINE_TRACE_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)

#define WARN                       WINE_WARN
#define WARN_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)                  WINE_WARN_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)
#define WARN_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)                WINE_WARN_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)

#define FIXME                      WINE_FIXME
#define FIXME_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)                 WINE_FIXME_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)
#define FIXME_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)               WINE_FIXME_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)

#define ERR                        WINE_ERR
#define ERR_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)                   WINE_ERR_(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)
#define ERR_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)                 WINE_ERR_ON(<span class="hljs-name">ch</span>)

#define MESSAGE                    WINE_MESSAGE
</code></pre>
<p>
	I&#39;m going to use the <code>MESSAGE</code> function for this case. So, all I did to print
	<em>Hello, World!</em> was adding <code>MESSAGE(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);</code> at the
	beginning of the <code>DllMain</code> function inside
	<code>wine/dlls/kernel32/kernel_main.c</code>. <code>DllMain</code> is the first function that
	gets executed when a DLL is loaded and, since <code>kernel32.dll</code> gets loaded by
	basically every Windows application, I can be sure that the message is always printed.
</p>
<p>
	Now I simply compile Proton again, copy it to the correct directory, restart Steam and start a
	game. Result: there&#39;s a bunch of <em>Hello, World!</em> messages in the game&#39;s log
	files! I assume the message gets printed multiple times because the DLL gets loaded multiple
	times.
</p>
<p>
	That&#39;s all for the first post of this series! Next time, we&#39;ll be doing something much
	more interesting!
