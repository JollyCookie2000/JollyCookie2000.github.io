Hello! My name is Lorenzo and I'm from Switzerland. I got my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering about a year ago.

I discovered programming in middle school while trying out various mods for the video game *Minecraft* and I stumbled upon a mod called *ComputerCraft*. The mod adds a simple computer to the game that can be programmed using the Lua programming language. I instantly fell in love - there was something about writing code and seeing it execute that instantly made me think: this is what I want to do.

Since then I've been trying out many programming languages and technologies: Java, Unity 3D (C#), C++, Python, Rust and recently TypeScript. A couple of years before university I discovered Linux and, after trying out a dual-boot setup for a few months, I switched to Linux full-time (I use Fedora btw). Shortly after, I built a small homelab, where I host a calendar, network share, file sync, notes, an RSS aggregator and other services I use daily.

I'm currently doing an internship at a software development company where I've had the chance to work on many different projects using many different technologies - Java, Spring Boot, TypeScript and Angular. Many projects have been deployed to production. One of the projects involves building an advanced RAG-powered AI chatbot.

My New Year's resolution for 2026 is to contribute to an open-source project. I use open-source projects like KDE Plasma, Wine/DXVK and Linux daily, so my goal is to submit at least one patch to one of those projects this year.

Besides technology, I enjoy reading, walking in nature and spending time with my cat Neko.
